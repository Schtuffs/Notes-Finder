:Test File :Test :File
- This file is to show how the program works
-- Such as formatting
--- With extra lines
-- Or selecting a file
- Also allows for testing functionality

:This is a header :Header
- This is a point
-- This is a subpoint
--- This is a sub-subpoint
---- etc.
- The subpoints extend their way out
- But new points go back to the other layer
--- Also, notice the point level for this point
--- The point lost a level to account for the "accidental" extra hyphen

:How to use
- Semi-colon: ':' used for headers
- Hyphen: '-' used for point indentation, multiple means lower layer
- Planning to add
-- Asterisk: '*' used to highlight important point, put after hyphens
-- Planning to add extra functionality by being able to select colour to use
-- Not sure how I want the colour selection to be implemented yet though
---*0x00FF00 Maybe this will make it green
---* a certain word will be *red*0xFF0000
