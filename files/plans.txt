:Project Plans :Plans
- This isn't exactly intended for everyday use
-- More of a proof of concept?
-- Fun to play around with
-- Maybe more useful if I allow the user to add data
--- Means manual formatting would not be fully required
- This project was made to practice parsing data
-- I intend to add some other functions
--- Finding a specific header
--- Finding/Displaying a single section
--- Finding/Displaying multiple, but only selected sections
---- User would enter the header name, or part of it, and function would look for said header
---- Hopefully would use multithreading for faster searching through each file simultaneously
---- Some sort of lock will be required on the display function
--- Add extra formatting options for colouring for important points
--- Add extra formatting options for colouring single words
- I also wanted to practice my file handling for my next project
-- I hope to work a bit with OpenGL to create Chess
--- We will see how that goes
-- Its not exactly the same, but a small refresher will be good
--- I hope to implement a simple AI to play against or allow 2 player mode
--- Files can maybe be used for a simple library containing openers
--- Parsing will be important to turn strings into actual board states
