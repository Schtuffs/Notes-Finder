:Changes v1.0 :v1.0
- Added file reading
- Can output all of the information in the read files
-- Does formatting based on key characters

:Changes v1.1 :v1.1
- Added an extension checker
-- No longer will .docx files break the system
-- Currently only allows .txt files
--- Maybe will add ability to parse other filetypes
--- Maybe will convert other filetypes into .txt?
- Added a commandline argument parser
-- use -h for a help menu
- Added the ability to read a single file instead of all files
-- Can enter the number to select the file
-- Can enter the file name
--- Doesn't work if filename has spaces
---- Use the number instead
- Changed some logic in filereader to allow for a different filepath
-- I've been doing testing to make sure its working properly
-- Everything seems to be good

Changes v1.2
- Added multi-file selection
-- Allows you to select multiple files and print them to the screen
-- Automatically filters out duplicate entries so they are only read once
- Fixed some bugs
-- Fixed bug where reading a file with a header but no point prints infititely
-- Fixed some empty lines from being added to data section
-- Fixed bug with multiple lines of headers in a row
-- Fixed bug with user selecting files crashing when entering a mix of random characters and numbers
- Moved the parsing to the data section
-- File handler should only deal with getting the data from the file
-- Data section should deal with the actual data and what to do with it
- Changed formatting
-- Headers no longer require the ':'
-- Printing only has 1 header
-- Previous versions will still have the old formatting
--- Still gets parsed, but only at the beginning
- Some general code cleanup
-- Removed some more nested items
-- Hope I cleaned up readability with some early-returns and changing some loop break conditions
